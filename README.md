# Nearest-Neighbor
• Determined experimentally that scipy.spatial.distance.euclidean is the fastest Euclidean distance implementation.
• Implemented k-fold cross validation yourself.
• Implemented 1-NN using loops and a higher-order function, finding that the higher-order function
approach executes more quickly.
• Implemented 1-NN using a higher-order function in a class compatible with built-in k-fold cross
validation features from scikit-learn.
• Preprocessed data via normalization and standardization, and observed experimentally the
benefits of doing so.
• Applied visualization tools in order to draw conclusions about a dataset.
• Converted your 1-NN class into a k-NN class.
• Determined an ideal hyperparameterization, both visually and computationally, of your k-NN
model for the Wine dataset.
